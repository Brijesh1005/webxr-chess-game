#### Set up instructions
Set up instructions are mentioned [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/ar-with-webxr/#1)

#### Current state of the application
The Chess game was built to get hands on [WebXR Device API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) and in no way game was expected to work fully. WebXR is still in development phase and developers from Mozilla, Google and Microsoft working together to make WebXR better and bring it in their respective browsers.

* If you observe all the chess pieces looks similar and for starter you can use the direction of chess piece to recognise which one is yours.
* I have not coded all the chess game rules

This application is only to demonstrate the power of WebXR.
